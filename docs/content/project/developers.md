# Developer information

You are encouraged to [contribute](/project/contribute/) to Nikita. There are multiple ways to offer assistance to the project. To fix and write actions, you will have to get your hands dirty and dive into the source code. This page describes the project layout and how to run the tests.

Before starting with Nikita development, read the [project architecture](/project/architecture/), it presents how to project is organized in the Git repository.

## Tests execution

Nikita targets Unix-like systems including Linux and macOS. Windows is not supported as a targeting node where actions are executed. It is however known to work as a Nikita host. This means you can run Nikita from a Windows host and target Linux nodes over SSH.

Tests are executed with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Should.js](https://shouldjs.github.io/). They are all located inside the "./test" folder.

For the tests to execute successfully, you must:

* be online (attempt to fetch an FTP file)
* be able to ssh yourself (eg `ssh $(whoami)@localhost`) without a password

Install Nikita with Yarn:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adaltas/node-nikita.git nikita
# Go to your nikita folder
cd ~/nikita
# Install the package dependencies and bootstrap Lerna
yarn install
```

`yarn test` executes the full test suite while `npx mocha test/your_choice/*.coffee` executes a subset of the test suite. For example, to only test the `nikita.file.ini` actions, run the following:

```bash
cd packages/file && npx mocha test/ini.coffee
```

To run all package tests from the project directory run: 

```bash
yarn workspace @nikitajs/core run test
```

## SSH or locally

Why even choose? All tests when it makes sense are executed twice. Once without an SSH connection and once with an SSH connection pointing to `localhost`. To achieve this behavior, we extended [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) by providing an alternative to the `it` function in the name of `they`. You can find it in the [mocha-they package](https://github.com/adaltas/node-ssh2-they).

For example, this test will only be executed locally:

```js
const nikita = require('nikita');
describe('Simple Test', function() {
  it('Check a file is touched', function() {
    nikita
    .file.touch('/tmp/a_file')
    .fs.assert('/tmp/a_file')
  })
})
```

While the same test using `they` will be executed locally and remotely using provided configuration:

```js
const nikita = require('nikita');
const {config} = require './test'
const they = require('mocha-they')(config);
describe('Simple Test', function() {
  they('Check a file is touched', function(ssh) {
    nikita({$ssh: ssh})
    .file.touch('/tmp/a_file')
    .fs.assert('/tmp/a_file')
  })
})
```

## Configuration customization

By default, tests will look for a configuration module located at the "./test.coffee" file. If they don't find it, they will copy the sample "./test.sample.coffee" file into "./test.coffee". Use the sample file as a starting point to configure your own environment.

You can also customize the path to the configuration module by setting the environmental variable named `NIKITA_TEST_MODULE`.

## Environments

Some tests depend on particular settings to run successfully. Some actions are specific to a particular Linux distribution or issue internally alternatives commands which must be validated. Other actions depend on a service that is not always available on the host machine such as a database connection.

Based on your environment support, targeted tests can be activated from the configuration. Tests are labeled with tags. The environment defines the test coverage by activating tags in their `test.coffee` configuration file. For example, to activate the MariaDB tests located in the ["db" package](https://github.com/adaltas/node-nikita/blob/master/packages/db/env/mariadb/test.coffee), set the `tags.db` property to `true` and configure the `db.mariadb` properties accordingly.

## Docker

To ensure tests are executed in a proper environment, we leverage [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). To each environment corresponds a directory inside the "./env" folder. Inside each folder, you will find the "docker-compose.yml" declaration file and its associated resources.

- `docker-compose.yml`   
  The [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file declares the Nikita container with its test environment as well as its service dependencies such as databases services.
- `Dockerfile`   
  The [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) declares instructions to build the containers.
- `test.coffee`   
  The configuration file is used to activate selected tests and configured the Nikita sessions executed inside.

The commands to execute the tests are common to every Docker environment and provide a lot of flexibility. From any environment directory, you can run:

* `docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit`   
  Run the all test suite from the host shell.
* `docker-compose run --rm nodejs`   
  Enter inside the Nikita container and execute your commands.
* `docker-compose run --rm nodejs 'test/**/*.coffee'`   
  Run a subset of the tests from the host shell.

Here's an example to run tests on CentOS 7:

```bash
# Download the source code
git clone https://github.com/adaltas/node-nikita.git nikita
cd nikita
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Navigate to the target environment
cd packages/core/env/centos7
# Run all tests
docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit
# Run a subset of the tests
docker-compose run --rm nodejs test/actions/execute/*.coffee
# Enter bash console
docker-compose run --rm nodejs
```

## LXD

Some tests are executed using [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/). The tests require a local LXD client. To install it on a Linux host, you can follow the [installation instructions](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/). On non-Linux hosts, you can set up the client to communicate with a remote LXD server hosted on a virtual machine. However, you will have to mount the project directory into the "/nikita" folder of the virtual machine. The provided [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/adaltas/node-nikita/blob/master/packages/lxd/assets/Vagrantfile) definition inside the "packages/lxd/assets" folder will set you up.

For Windows and macOS users, the procedure is abstracted inside the `./bin/cluster start` command:

```bash
# For Windows and macOS users
cd packages/lxd
./bin/cluster start
yarn test
```

The manual commands to make it work are below:

* Install:

```bash
# Initialize the VM
cd packages/lxd/assets && vagrant up && cd ../../
# Set up LXD client
lxc remote add nikita 127.0.0.1:8443
lxc remote switch nikita
# Navigate to the target environment
cd ipa/env/ipa
# Initialize the container
npx coffee start.coffee
```

* Update the VM:

```bash
lxc remote switch local
lxc remote remove nikita
# Note, password is "secret"
lxc remote add nikita 127.0.0.1:8443
lxc remote switch nikita
```

If you are running into an issue with permission on the "tmp" folder as below:

```bash
[1/29]: configuring certificate server instance
[error] IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/tmp_Tm1l_'
```

Host must have `fs.protected_regular` set to `0`r, eg `echo '0' > /proc/sys/fs/protected_regular && sysctl -p && sysctl -a`. In our Physical -> VM -> LXD setup, the parameters shall be set in the VM, no restart is required to install the FreeIPA server, just uninstall it first with `ipa-server-install --uninstall` before re-executing the install command.

Here's a complete example to run tests for the ["ipa" package](https://github.com/adaltas/node-nikita/tree/master/packages/ipa):

```bash
# For Windows and macOS users
./packages/lxd/bin/cluster start
export NIKITA_HOME=/nikita
cd packages/ipa
# Start the server
npx coffee ./env/ipa/start.coffee
# Run all the tests
lxc exec nikita-ipa --cwd /nikita/packages/ipa npx mocha 'test/**/*.coffee'
# Run selected tests
lxc exec nikita-ipa --cwd /nikita/packages/ipa npx mocha 'test/user/exists.coffee'
# Enter the IPA container
lxc exec nikita-ipa --cwd /nikita/packages/ipa bash
```
