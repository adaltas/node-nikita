# Children

A Nikita session is organized as a hierarchical tree of action. Actions have [parent](/current/api/parent/) and children. The children are the actions executed in the handler of a parent action.

The `children` property of an action exposes an array with all the executed actions inside of it. In the `handler` function, `children` is a property available inside its first argument.

## Properties

The child action objects contain the following properties:

- `children`   
  The child actions relative to the current action.
- `metadata`   
  The [metadata properties](/current/api/metadata/) of the action.
- `config`   
  The [configuration properties](/current/api/config/) passed to an action call.
- `error`   
  The [error object](/current/guide/error/) in a rejected action.
- `output`   
  The [returned output](/current/api/output/) in a fulfilled action.

## Usage

The `children` property of the parent action is enriched once a child action complete its execution, wether it is fulfilled or rejected. Thus, it is accessed using the [`async`/`await` operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function):

```js
nikita
// Call a parent action
.call(async function({children}) {
  // Call a child action and wait until it is executed
  await this.call(() => true)
  // Print children
  console.info(children)
})
```
